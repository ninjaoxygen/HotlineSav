# Hotline Miami Save Unpacker

HotlineSav is a packer and unpacker for the newer format of Hotline Miami 1 SAV files (the non-Flash version of the game)

My save got broken going from the old format to the new format, my game progress never updated, so I wrote this tool to
see what was going on and allow editing of the files contained within the packed SAV format.

Download v1.0 from here:

https://github.com/ninjaoxygen/HotlineSav/releases/download/1.0.0/HotlineSav.exe

Usage:

HotlineSav unpack - unpacks .sav file into unpack folder
HotlineSav pack - pack unpack folder into .sav file

The saves are unpacked into an "Unpack" folder within the default save directory (Documents\My Games\HotlineMiami)
